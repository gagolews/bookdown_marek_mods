Some mods to the R package `bookdown` v0.19 that I use in my books' custom build chains.

In the unlikely event that anyone wants to compile my books from sources,
I've made this repository publicly available.

See https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown and https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown/issues
for the original version of `bookdown` â€” stick to it. Or [sphinx](https://sphinx-doc.org/).
